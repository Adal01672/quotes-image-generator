# quotes-image-generator
it uses an api to fetch the quotes and author names, python pillow then draw the texts into the background image where a faded filter is used, after that it saves the image inside the "quotesimg" folder.
**One thing to be noted tho that it uses an algorith where it doesnt let duplicate quote images do be generated.**
***i will make it more updated so that it can post on instagram after generated***[to be continued...]
